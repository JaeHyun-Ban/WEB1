      <div>In publishing and graphic design, Lorem ipsum is a placeholder text commonly used to demonstrate the visual
        form of a document or a typeface without relying on meaningful content. Lorem ipsum may be used before final
        copy is available, but it may also be used to temporarily replace copy in a process called greeking, which
        allows designers to consider form without the meaning of the text influencing the design.</div>
